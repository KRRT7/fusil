Fusil TODO list
===============

 * setup.py: run 2to3 on docstrings and rst files ("2to3 -w -d . doc/*.rst
   tests/*.rst"). See also python3.0.rst
 * replay.py is unable to open a file as stdin, required by fusil-gimp
 * Factorize code responsible to rename the session on process exit
   (share code between Debugger and CreateProcess)
 * Protect the terminal using setsid(), setpgrp(), or setpgid()
 * Use initgroups() in CreateProcess?
 * Remove the class WatchProcess: move code to CreateProcess to avoid duplicate
   events (agent score) and duplicate code
